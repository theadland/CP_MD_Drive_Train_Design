# CP_MD_Drive_Train_Design
This project is for the wood chipper transmission design project I did in my undergrad Machine Design course.

The main script file is wood_chipper_design_calcs.m and requires the other included function files to run properly.

It also includes a couple of relevant drawings of the system being designed.

The project was to design the transmission system for a consumer grade rotary wood chipping machine. The main focus
from an mechanical design perspective was a drive shaft that would need to be sized for the given loads and that
would need to have an infinite fatigue life.
